Views
Your application should have, at a minimum, four views:

Default (Root)
should list all available categories, which should link to a category view for that category
should list all of the posts
should have a control for changing the sort method for the list, including at minimum, order by voteScore and order by timestamp
should have a control for adding a new post

Category View
identical to the default view, but filtered to only include posts with the selected category

Post Detail View
should show the details of a post, including: Title, Body, Author, timestamp (in user readable format), and vote score
should list all of the comments for that post
should have controls to edit or delete the post
should have a control to add a new comment.
implement comment form however you want (inline, modal, etc.)
comments should also have controls for editing or deleting

Create/Edit View
should have a form to create new post or edit existing posts
when editing, existing data should be populated in the form

Post/Comment UI
Posts and comments, in all views where they are displayed, should display their current score
and should have controls to increment or decrement the voteScore for the object.
Posts should display the number of comments associated with the post.
